use functional programming principles
use layers of abstraction clearly
all code in english
use pydoc for documentation of all classes and functions
use python libraries to the fullest, find good libraries that can handle for example the svg creation and parsing with higher level abstatrictions. then package those functions into higler level abstractions that are directed towards the current ussage as specified in the IEC_LIBRARY_PRINCIPLES.md file
use py (not python) to run python from the commmand line
